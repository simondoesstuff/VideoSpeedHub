# Video Speed Control

Chrome extension; allows you to control video playback speed on any site with included keybinds.

I personally added a switch in the extension pop-up menu
that allows you to toggle the keybinds. They can
get in the way occasionally. I also did a brief scan for viruses. Removed the analyticsJS.

    Cloned from 'Video Speed Hub' on the edge add-on store on 6/22/2022. The majority of the code was not written by me. I only modified the existing technology slightly.
