# Video Speed Control

Forked from 'Video Speed Hub'.

Lets you control video playback speed on any site
with included keybinds.

I personally added a switch in the extension pop-up menu
that allows you to toggle the keybinds. They can
get in the way occasionally.

I also did a brief scan for viruses and removed
the analyticsJS.
